A widely-cited 2012 report from The U.S. Government Accountability Office identified 400 non-federally recognized Tribes, but did not enumerate them. “No official list of non-federally recognized tribes similar to BIA’s (Bureau of Indian Affairs) list of federally recognized Indian Tribes exists,” the report reads. To get as close to this number as possible, our maps pull from the 2012 GAO report, a 2013 list of tribes petitioning the Bureau of Indian Affairs for recognition, and the BIA database of active or resolved petitioners. Our analysis accounted for 352 non-federally recognized tribes as of July 2024. The BIA did not respond to requests for comment.
